# custom_components
My collection of components for esphome

In order to use these components, you have two options:
1. clone this repo directly into your `config` directory.  This will make all of the components available.
2. clone it somewhere else, create a `custom_components` directory in your `config` diretory, and then copy the specific component directories that you want into there.
